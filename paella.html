    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Paella Rice.</li>
        <li>Shrimp, Mussels,etc.</li>
        <li>Diced Onions.</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers (Red and Green).</li>
        <li>Garlic (minced).</li>
        <li>Diced Tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Smoked of Paprika.</li>
        <li>Chicken or Vegetable Broth (Use water if unavailable).</li>
        <li>Olive Oil (For sautéing).</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Lemon Wedges and fresh parsley for garnish (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, shallow pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and bell peppers and sauté until they soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li> Add the paella rice to the pan and stir to coat it with the oil and vegetables. Sprinkle the paprika over the rice and stir to evenly distribute.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken or vegetable broth (or water) into the pan and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook for a few minutes until they start to break down.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer the paella for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. Check and stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Carefully arrange the mixed seafood on top of the rice. Push the seafood down into the rice mixture slightly but do not stir after this point.</li>
        <li> Cover the pan again and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the paella from the heat and let it rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld. If you have lemon wedges and fresh parsley, garnish the paella before serving.</li>
